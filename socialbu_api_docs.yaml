        Upload media files to your posts.
          
        It involves a three-step process:
          1. Get a signed URL for direct media upload to SocialBu's storage using `POST /upload_media`.
          2. Use the signed_url from Step 1 to upload your actual file (video/image) directly to SocialBu’s storage.
          3. Once the file is uploaded, confirm its status using the media key returned in Step 1 via `/upload_media/status`.
          
        Now that the media is uploaded and verified, you can attach this file to your post using the upload_token recieved in Step 3.
